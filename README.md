# Daylight Difference 
## Type in the name of any major city and see how much longer or shorter today is compared to yesterday and tomorrow!
## Try it out: https://daylightdifference.netlify.app/
## How it's Made 

#### This project is built on the sunrise-sunset.org API and the API-Ninjas Geocoding API. This projects encorporates OOP best practices as well as the fundamentals of asyncronous programming in order to ensure blocking action between the two API calls. 


## Optimizations 

#### With further development the app could give users a chance to select smaller cities, for example if they wanted data on Paris, Texas, instead of Paris, France. It could also handle the solstices, which it currently will not handle properly.
